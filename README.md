SQLAlchemy ORM example

Example code showing how to use the SQLAlchemy ORM. In this example we create a
simple model of users and topics.  Users can create new topics, and any user
can vote (once) on any topic.

The examples are done in 5 stages.

1. Create the initial model.
2. Insert some test data.
3. Define a one-to-many relationship.
4. Define a many-to-many relationship.
5. Add some query methods to the model.
